As the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district, I helped the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Here I analyzed data across 15 unique schools, almost 40,000 students, budgets, and computed average scores which I categorizing into various functional tables. 

From this data, a noticable observation I drew from my analysis was that, overall, larger schools had only almost half of the student population passing in math and reading scores. The larger school overall passing score was 58%, which was significantly lower then the 90% smaller and medium schools produced. This led me to the conlusion that medium and smaller school were much better learning enviroments, specifically for math and reading, per my analysis.

Additionally, and not sure if this is due to a standard rate, I noticed regardles of the school size and budget, the "Per Student Budget" stayed within a $100 range, about $580 at the lowest and $650 at the highest. Letting one know, small schools do still have a decent sized budget per student, even with a smaller schcool budget.  






Things to note: for this homework, additional support was provided by office hours from Richard and Andy, and the new Xpert Learning Assistnat was most useful for quick questions arounf the clock.
